IoT Security System with ESP32 and ESP32-CAM



This repository contains the code and documentation for an IoT-based security system implemented using ESP32 and ESP32-CAM modules. The system is designed to provide an affordable and customizable solution for monitoring and securing your environment. With this project, you can set up a basic security camera system that captures images and videos and sends notifications when motion is detected.

Key Features:

- ESP32 and ESP32-CAM: Utilizes the ESP32 and ESP32-CAM modules for low-power, wireless communication and image/video capture capabilities.

- Motion Detection: The system includes motion detection using the ESP32-CAM's PIR sensor, enabling it to capture images or record videos upon motion detection.

- Real-Time Notifications: Receive real-time notifications and alerts on your smartphone or other devices when motion is detected.

- Web-Based Control: A simple web interface is provided for configuring and monitoring the security system.

- Customization: The code is highly customizable, allowing you to adapt it to your specific needs, including integrating with cloud storage or other IoT platforms.

Getting Started:

1. Hardware Setup: Follow our step-by-step guide for wiring and configuring the ESP32 and ESP32-CAM modules.

2. Software Installation: Flash the provided firmware to your ESP32 module and set up the required software components.

3. Configuration: Customize the system settings and integrate it with your preferred notification service.

4. Usage: Monitor and secure your space with your newly created IoT security system.
